 * license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 * Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
 * submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
 * lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
 * patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
 * the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 * 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
 * with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

 * NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
 * along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
 * third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
 * modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 * or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
 * construed as modifying the License.
 *
 * You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms
 * and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a
 * whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
 * this License.
 *
 * 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for
 * inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

 * separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 * 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product
 * names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
 * reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 * 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and
 * each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
 * either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
 * MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness
 * of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
 * License.
 *
 * 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
 * or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
 * writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
 * consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 * Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
 * any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
 * damages.
 *
 * 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
 * choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
 * and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
 * behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 * defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
 * Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
